The general configuration for Alex! Press is quite simple

```yaml
theme:
    title:
        fr: 'Alex Press'
        en: 'Alex Press'
    icon: '/assets/user/imgs/icon.svg'
    start: 'guide'
```

- You specify the title in the languages you are using. This is displayed near the logo.
- The `icon` field specifies the logo.
- The `start` field specifies the menu that is going to be displayed when clicking on "get started".
